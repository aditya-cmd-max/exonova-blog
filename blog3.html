  <h2>✨ Blog#3 Concept</h2>
  <p class="concept-intro">
    Everyone tells us to <strong>“learn answers”</strong>, but few teach us how to ask the <strong>right questions</strong>.
    This blog flips the idea: the smartest people in the world—from Einstein to Steve Jobs—weren’t answer seekers,
    they were <em>question askers</em>.
  </p>
  <ul class="concept-points">
    <li>🔍 Shift the focus from answers to deeper inquiry.</li>
    <li>🧠 Highlight how curiosity shaped world-changing ideas.</li>
    <li>🚀 Inspire students to think, not just memorize.</li>
    <li>📘 Real-life stories from history and tech innovators.</li>
  </ul>

    <p>“In schools, we’re taught to give answers. But in real life? The question is everything.”</p>
    <p>From childhood curiosity to groundbreaking discoveries, every great idea begins with a question. History is filled with thinkers like Newton, Einstein, and Curie—who didn’t just seek answers, but dared to ask why things are the way they are. It’s this fearless curiosity, this refusal to accept the world at face value, that fuels genius. Questions aren’t a sign of ignorance; they’re a spark for innovation.</p>
    <p>In school and in life, we’re often taught to memorize answers. But real growth happens when we challenge what's already known. Asking “What if?” or “Why not?” opens doors to perspectives others overlook. Steve Jobs once said, “Stay hungry, stay foolish,”—because it’s the foolish who dare to ask questions that haven’t been answered yet. Whether you're a student or a scientist, it's the questions you ask that define your journey.</p>
   <p>So, how do you train your mind to ask better questions? Start by being curious about everything—observe, reflect, and don't be afraid of not knowing. Great minds aren’t built by knowledge alone; they’re shaped by the courage to question the obvious. The next time something puzzles you, don’t just search for an answer. Sit with the question, explore it deeply—and you just might stumble upon your own genius.</p>
