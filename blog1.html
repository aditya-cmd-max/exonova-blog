    <p>The future of education is digital, interactive, and personalized. As technology continues to evolve, classrooms are transforming into dynamic learning environments powered by AI, VR, and cloud-based platforms.</p>
    <p>AI tutors can now adapt to individual student needs, providing custom feedback and support. Virtual Reality brings history, science, and even outer space to life in ways that textbooks never could. Education is no longer confined to four walls but has become a global, continuous process.</p>
    <p>As we embrace this change, we must also ensure access and equity. Technology must empower all learners, regardless of location or background. The future of education is not just about smart tools‚Äîit's about smarter, more inclusive learning for everyone.</p>
