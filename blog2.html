  <h2>✨ Blog Concept</h2>
  <p class="concept-intro">
    Everyone tells us to <strong>“learn answers”</strong>, but few teach us how to ask the <strong>right questions</strong>.
    This blog flips the idea: the smartest people in the world—from Einstein to Steve Jobs—weren’t answer seekers,
    they were <em>question askers</em>.
  </p>
  <ul class="concept-points">
    <li>🔍 Shift the focus from answers to deeper inquiry.</li>
    <li>🧠 Highlight how curiosity shaped world-changing ideas.</li>
    <li>🚀 Inspire students to think, not just memorize.</li>
    <li>📘 Real-life stories from history and tech innovators.</li>
  </ul>

    <p>The future of education is digital, interactive, and personalized. As technology continues to evolve, classrooms are transforming into dynamic learning environments powered by AI, VR, and cloud-based platforms.</p>
    <p>AI tutors can now adapt to individual student needs, providing custom feedback and support. Virtual Reality brings history, science, and even outer space to life in ways that textbooks never could. Education is no longer confined to four walls but has become a global, continuous process.</p>
    <p>As we embrace this change, we must also ensure access and equity. Technology must empower all learners, regardless of location or background. The future of education is not just about smart tools—it's about smarter, more inclusive learning for everyone.</p>
